    /* unsigned integers: These are integers that can hold positive values. unsigned integers range from 0 to 255.
       "unit age" by default has memory of 256.
       "unit8 age" has less memory ie less space. it consumes less gas on the ethereum network. age is usually max 120yrs.
       But in ths case of "accountBalance", this can be any amount of money ie $100 or $100,000,000, we can assign it "uint".
       It makes economic sense assigning age 'unit8' than 'unit'.
       Its always useful to be specific when assigning memory in order to save space.
